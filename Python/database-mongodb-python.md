Connecting MongoDB with an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in Python, handling migrations, and seeding data involves using a tool like `MongoEngine` or `Peewee` for MongoDB, and additional scripts or tools for managing migrations and seeding. MongoDB is a NoSQL database and doesn't use traditional SQL-based schemas, so the process differs from relational databases.

### 1. Install Required Packages

First, install MongoEngine (a popular ODM for MongoDB in Python) and any additional packages you may need for migrations and seeding.

```bash
pip install mongoengine
```

For migrations, you generally use a package like `mongomock` for testing purposes or create custom scripts for actual database management, as traditional migrations are less common in NoSQL databases.

### 2. Set Up MongoEngine Configuration

Create a file named `database.py` to configure your MongoDB connection using MongoEngine.

```python
from mongoengine import connect

# Connect to MongoDB
connect(
    db='your_db_name',
    host='localhost',
    port=27017,
    username='your_username',  # Optional
    password='your_password',  # Optional
)
```

### 3. Define Your Models

Create a `models.py` file to define your schema using MongoEngine.

```python
from mongoengine import Document, fields

class User(Document):
    name = fields.StringField(required=True)
    email = fields.EmailField(unique=True)
```

### 4. Handle Migrations

MongoDB is schema-less, meaning it doesn't require schema migrations in the same way SQL databases do. However, you can still manage changes to your documents or collections using custom scripts or tools.

#### Custom Migration Scripts

You can write custom scripts to migrate your data or adjust your document structure.

For example, to update all documents in a collection, you could write:

```python
from models import User

def migrate_users():
    for user in User.objects:
        # Perform migration logic here
        # Example: Add a new field with a default value
        if not hasattr(user, 'new_field'):
            user.update(set__new_field='default_value')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    migrate_users()
```

### 5. Seed the Database

You can create a `seeder.py` file to insert initial data into MongoDB.

```python
from models import User

def seed_db():
    # Add initial data
    user1 = User(name="John Doe", email="john@example.com")
    user2 = User(name="Jane Doe", email="jane@example.com")
    
    user1.save()
    user2.save()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    seed_db()
```

### Summary

1. **Install the packages**: Use `MongoEngine` for ORM-like capabilities with MongoDB.
2. **Configure MongoEngine**: Set up your connection to MongoDB.
3. **Define your models**: Create classes for your MongoDB documents.
4. **Handle migrations**: Use custom scripts or manual updates, as traditional migrations are not standard with NoSQL databases.
5. **Seed your database**: Write a script to insert initial data.

By following these steps, you can connect MongoDB with an ORM-like tool in Python, manage your document schema, and seed your database.
