Redis is a key-value store and doesn't have a traditional schema or support for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in the way that relational databases do. Instead, you interact with Redis using a client library and manage data using commands tailored to Redis's data structures.

### 1. Install Required Packages

You'll need a Redis client library for Python. `redis-py` is the most commonly used library for interacting with Redis.

```bash
pip install redis
```

### 2. Set Up Redis Configuration

Create a file named `redis_config.py` to configure your Redis connection.

```python
import redis

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(
    host='localhost',
    port=6379,
    db=0,
    decode_responses=True  # Optional: to work with strings instead of bytes
)
```

### 3. Define Your Data Models

Since Redis does not have schemas, you'll be working with data structures like strings, lists, sets, hashes, and sorted sets. You can define how you want to store and retrieve your data in Python classes or functions.

Here's an example using Python functions to manage user data with Redis hashes:

```python
from redis_config import redis_client

def create_user(user_id, name, email):
    redis_client.hset(f"user:{user_id}", mapping={"name": name, "email": email})

def get_user(user_id):
    return redis_client.hgetall(f"user:{user_id}")

def delete_user(user_id):
    redis_client.delete(f"user:{user_id}")
```

### 4. Handle Migrations

Redis doesn't support migrations in the traditional sense because it doesnâ€™t have schemas. However, you can use Python scripts to perform data migrations or transformations.

For example, if you need to add a new field to existing user records:

```python
def migrate_users():
    for user_key in redis_client.scan_iter("user:*"):
        redis_client.hset(user_key, "new_field", "default_value")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    migrate_users()
```

### 5. Seed the Database

Create a `seeder.py` file to insert initial data into Redis.

```python
from redis_config import redis_client

def seed_db():
    # Add initial data
    redis_client.hset("user:1", mapping={"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"})
    redis_client.hset("user:2", mapping={"name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@example.com"})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    seed_db()
```

### Summary

1. **Install the package**: Use `redis-py` for interacting with Redis.
2. **Configure Redis**: Set up your Redis connection.
3. **Define your data models**: Use Redis data structures (strings, hashes, sets, etc.) and functions to manage data.
4. **Handle migrations**: Write custom scripts to migrate or transform data as needed.
5. **Seed your database**: Create scripts to populate Redis with initial data.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and interact with Redis in Python, even though Redis itself does not support traditional ORM or migrations.
