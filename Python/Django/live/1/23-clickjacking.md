Clickjacking is a web security exploit where a malicious site tricks a user into clicking something different from what the user perceives, potentially leading to unintended actions. This can be a concern in Django applications, as in any web application.

To protect your Django application from clickjacking, you can use the `X-Frame-Options` HTTP header. This header prevents your site from being embedded in a frame, iframe, or object on another site, which mitigates the risk of clickjacking.

Here’s how you can add this protection to your Django application:

### 1. Use Django's Built-in Middleware

Django provides built-in middleware to set the `X-Frame-Options` header. To use it, you need to add `XFrameOptionsMiddleware` to your `MIDDLEWARE` setting. This middleware is enabled by default in Django.

In your `settings.py` file:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # Other middleware classes
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
    # More middleware classes
]
```

By default, this middleware sets the `X-Frame-Options` header to `DENY`, which means that your site cannot be displayed in a frame or iframe at all.

### 2. Customize `X-Frame-Options`

If you want to allow your site to be framed only by specific sites or in certain contexts, you can configure the `X-Frame-Options` header to `SAMEORIGIN` or use the `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY` header for more granular control.

- **DENY**: No domain can frame your site.
- **SAMEORIGIN**: Only pages from the same origin can frame your site.

To set this explicitly, you can use the `X_FRAME_OPTIONS` setting in `settings.py`:

```python
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN'
```

### 3. Use Content Security Policy (CSP)

For more advanced control, you might consider using the Content Security Policy (CSP) header to manage framing. This allows for more flexible policies:

```python
# settings.py

CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS = ["'self'"]
```

You may need to install and configure a package like `django-csp` to use CSP with Django:

```sh
pip install django-csp
```

Add `csp.middleware.CSPMiddleware` to your `MIDDLEWARE`:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # Other middleware classes
    'csp.middleware.CSPMiddleware',
    # More middleware classes
]
```

And configure the policy:

```python
CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS = ["'self'"]
```

### Summary

By configuring Django's middleware and settings, you can effectively protect your application from clickjacking attacks. Ensure you test your application thoroughly after applying these settings to verify that they don’t interfere with your site’s functionality.
