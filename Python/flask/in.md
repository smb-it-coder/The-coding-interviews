40. **How would you integrate Flask with a front-end framework like React or Angular?**

### Sample Code for Key Topics

**Example 1: Handling Errors Globally**

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.errorhandler(404)
def not_found(error):
    return jsonify({'error': 'Not found'}), 404

@app.errorhandler(500)
def internal_error(error):
    return jsonify({'error': 'Internal server error'}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Example 2: Using Blueprints**

```python
from flask import Flask, Blueprint

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a blueprint
bp = Blueprint('main', __name__)

@bp.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'

app.register_blueprint(bp)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Example 3: Implementing a Simple REST API**

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

items = []

@app.route('/items', methods=['GET'])
def get_items():
    return jsonify(items)

@app.route('/items', methods=['POST'])
def add_item():
    item = request.json
    items.append(item)
    return jsonify(item), 201

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

These questions and examples cover a broad range of topics that reflect the depth of experience you might expect from a Flask developer with 5 years of experience. The focus is on both fundamental concepts and advanced features that are crucial for building and maintaining Flask applications.
