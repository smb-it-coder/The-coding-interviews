For someone with 5 years of experience working with Flask, interview questions are likely to cover a range of topics from advanced concepts to best practices in web development. Here’s a list of potential interview questions that might be asked for a Flask developer with this level of experience:

### Flask Basics and Core Concepts

1. **What are the key features of Flask that distinguish it from other web frameworks?**
   - Expected Answer: Flask is a microframework with minimal dependencies, providing flexibility and simplicity. Key features include its simplicity, ease of use, and a modular approach.

2. **Explain how Flask handles routing and request processing.**
   - Expected Answer: Flask uses decorators to map URLs to functions. When a request is made, Flask looks up the URL pattern in the route definitions and calls the associated view function.

3. **What is the purpose of the `Flask` object and how do you create it?**
   - Expected Answer: The `Flask` object is the core of a Flask application. It is instantiated with the name of the module or package as an argument, usually with `app = Flask(__name__)`.

### Flask Extensions and Advanced Topics

4. **How do you manage configurations in Flask?**
   - Expected Answer: Configurations can be managed using the `config` attribute of the `Flask` object. Configurations can be loaded from environment variables, configuration files, or directly set in the code.

5. **What is the use of Flask extensions, and can you name a few commonly used ones?**
   - Expected Answer: Flask extensions add functionality to a Flask application, such as database integration, authentication, and form handling. Commonly used extensions include Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, Flask-WTF, and Flask-Login.

6. **Explain the concept of Flask Blueprints and their use cases.**
   - Expected Answer: Blueprints allow you to organize a Flask application into modules or components. They help in structuring large applications by grouping routes, templates, and static files together.

### Database Integration

7. **How do you integrate Flask with SQL databases?**
   - Expected Answer: Flask can be integrated with SQL databases using SQLAlchemy (Flask-SQLAlchemy extension). It allows for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and simplifies database operations.

8. **What is Flask-Migrate and how is it used in a Flask project?**
   - Expected Answer: Flask-Migrate is an extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations using Alembic. It allows you to manage schema changes and keep track of database migrations.

### Error Handling and Testing

9. **How do you handle errors and exceptions in Flask?**
   - Expected Answer: Errors and exceptions can be handled using error handlers. Flask provides the `@app.errorhandler` decorator to define custom error responses for different HTTP status codes.

10. **What tools or techniques do you use for testing Flask applications?**
    - Expected Answer: Common testing tools include pytest and Flask’s built-in test client. Tests can be written for unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

### Security and Performance

11. **How do you ensure security in a Flask application?**
    - Expected Answer: Security can be ensured by using secure cookies, implementing CSRF protection (with Flask-WTF), handling authentication and authorization properly, and validating and sanitizing user input.

12. **How do you improve the performance of a Flask application?**
    - Expected Answer: Performance can be improved by optimizing database queries, using caching (e.g., Flask-Caching), minimizing middleware, and using asynchronous tasks for long-running operations.

### Deployment and Best Practices

13. **What are the common deployment strategies for a Flask application?**
    - Expected Answer: Common deployment strategies include using WSGI servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI, and deploying with platforms such as Heroku, AWS, or Docker. It's also important to configure the application for production, including security settings and environment variables.

14. **What are some best practices you follow when developing Flask applications?**
    - Expected Answer: Best practices include using Blueprints for modularity, following the Flask application factory pattern, maintaining proper project structure, writing comprehensive tests, and adhering to security guidelines.

### Code Example Question

15. **Can you write a Flask route that accepts a JSON payload and returns a transformed response?**

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/transform', methods=['POST'])
    def transform():
        data = request.get_json()
        transformed_data = {key.upper(): value for key, value in data.items()}
        return jsonify(transformed_data)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

### Summary

For someone with 5 years of experience in Flask, questions will likely probe deeper into the intricacies of Flask’s features, extensions, and best practices. The focus will be on understanding advanced concepts, practical experience, and real-world application of Flask in various scenarios.
