Python 3 introduced several important changes and improvements over Python 2, which can affect compatibility between the two versions. Here are some key differences:

1. **Print Statement vs. Print Function**:
   - **Python 2**: `print` is a statement. For example: `print "Hello, world!"`.
   - **Python 3**: `print` is a function. For example: `print("Hello, world!")`.

2. **Integer Division**:
   - **Python 2**: Division of two integers performs floor division. For example, `5 / 2` results in `2`.
   - **Python 3**: Division of two integers results in a float. For example, `5 / 2` results in `2.5`. Use `//` for floor division.

3. **Unicode**:
   - **Python 2**: Strings are ASCII by default. Unicode strings require a `u` prefix, e.g., `u"Hello"`.
   - **Python 3**: All strings are Unicode by default. Byte strings require a `b` prefix, e.g., `b"Hello"`.

4. **xrange vs. range**:
   - **Python 2**: `xrange()` is used for efficient looping over a range of numbers. `range()` returns a list.
   - **Python 3**: `range()` behaves like `xrange()` in Python 2 (i.e., it returns an immutable sequence type). `xrange()` is not available.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - **Python 2**: `except` syntax is `except Exception, e:`.
   - **Python 3**: `except` syntax is `except Exception as e:`.

6. **Iterators and Generators**:
   - **Python 2**: Many functions like `dict.keys()`, `dict.items()`, and `dict.values()` return lists.
   - **Python 3**: These functions return view objects, which are more memory efficient.

7. **Input Function**:
   - **Python 2**: `raw_input()` is used for reading strings from input, and `input()` evaluates the input as code.
   - **Python 3**: `input()` reads strings from input, and `raw_input()` is not available.

8. **Standard Library Changes**:
   - **Python 3**: Some modules and functions have been renamed or reorganized. For instance, `urllib`, `urlparse`, and `ConfigParser` have different names or structures in Python 3.

9. **Function Annotations**:
   - **Python 3**: Function annotations are supported, allowing for optional type hints.

10. **Syntax Changes**:
    - **Python 3**: New syntax features include the `nonlocal` keyword, extended unpacking (`a, *rest = range(5)`), and f-strings for formatted string literals.

11. **Metaclasses**:
    - **Python 3**: The metaclass syntax is changed. In Python 2, you use `__metaclass__`, while in Python 3, you use the `metaclass` keyword in the class definition.

12. **Division of Classes**:
    - **Python 2**: Classes can inherit from both old-style and new-style classes.
    - **Python 3**: All classes are new-style classes, inheriting from `object`.

These changes make Python 3 more consistent and modern but also mean that code written for Python 2 may not run unmodified in Python 3.
