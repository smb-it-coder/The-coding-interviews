The MongoDB Aggregation Framework consists of various pipeline stages that allow you to process and manipulate documents as they pass through the pipeline. Each stage performs a specific operation on the input documents or the results of previous stages. Here are some common aggregation pipeline stages and their purposes:

1. **$match:**
   - Filters documents to pass only those that match a specified condition.
   - Similar to the `find()` method, but works within the aggregation pipeline.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     { $match: { status: "A" } }
     ```

2. **$group:**
   - Groups documents by a specified identifier expression and applies accumulator expressions to compute aggregated values.
   - Useful for calculating totals, averages, counts, etc., based on grouped data.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     {
       $group: {
         _id: "$department",
         avgSalary: { $avg: "$salary" },
         maxSalary: { $max: "$salary" },
         count: { $sum: 1 }
       }
     }
     ```

3. **$project:**
   - Reshapes documents by including, excluding, or renaming fields.
   - Computes new fields based on existing fields or expressions.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     {
       $project: {
         fullName: { $concat: ["$firstName", " ", "$lastName"] },
         age: 1,
         _id: 0
       }
     }
     ```

4. **$sort:**
   - Sorts documents based on one or more fields.
   - Allows ascending (`1`) or descending (`-1`) sorting.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     { $sort: { price: -1 } }
     ```

5. **$limit:**
   - Limits the number of documents passed to the next stage in the pipeline.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     { $limit: 10 }
     ```

6. **$skip:**
   - Skips a specified number of documents and passes the remaining documents to the next stage in the pipeline.
   - Useful for implementing pagination.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     { $skip: 5 }
     ```

7. **$unwind:**
   - Deconstructs an array field from the input documents and outputs one document for each element of the array.
   - Used to normalize data for further processing.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     { $unwind: "$tags" }
     ```

8. **$lookup:**
   - Performs a left outer join with another collection to enrich documents with data from the joined collection.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     {
       $lookup: {
         from: "inventory",
         localField: "item",
         foreignField: "sku",
         as: "inventory_docs"
       }
     }
     ```

9. **$addFields:**
   - Adds new fields to documents.
   - Computes new fields based on existing fields or expressions.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     {
       $addFields: {
         totalQuantity: { $sum: "$sizes.quantity" }
       }
     }
     ```

10. **$facet:**
    - Allows for multiple separate pipelines to be executed on the same set of input documents.
    - Useful for executing multiple aggregations simultaneously and combining their results.
    - Example:
      ```javascript
      {
        $facet: {
          topCategories: [
            { $sortByCount: "$category" },
            { $limit: 5 }
          ],
          avgPrice: [
            { $group: { _id: null, avgPrice: { $avg: "$price" } } }
          ]
        }
      }
      ```

These are some of the primary stages available in the MongoDB Aggregation Framework. Each stage enables you to perform specific operations on documents, allowing for sophisticated data processing and analysis within MongoDB.
