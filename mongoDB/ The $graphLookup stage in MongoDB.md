To find the entire employee hierarchy for a specific position, like the CTO, in both MySQL and MongoDB, you need to navigate through hierarchical data. The process involves finding the CTO and then recursively fetching all subordinates and their subordinates, and so on. 

Here's how you can achieve this in both MySQL and MongoDB:

### MySQL

In MySQL, you can use a recursive common table expression (CTE) to traverse the hierarchy. Assuming your tables are structured as follows:

**Employee Table:**
- `id` (Employee ID)
- `name` (Employee Name)
- `manager_id` (ID of the manager)

**Company Table:**
- `id` (Company ID)
- `name` (Company Name)

Here's how you can write a query to find all employees under the CTO:

1. **Find the CTO's ID:**
   You need to know the CTO's `id`. If you don’t have it directly, you may need to query it based on the company or other criteria.

2. **Use Recursive CTE to Find Hierarchy:**

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    -- Anchor member: Start with the CTO
    SELECT id, name, manager_id
    FROM employee
    WHERE name = 'CTO' -- Replace 'CTO' with the actual name or criteria

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive member: Find employees who report to the current level
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id
    FROM employee e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
```

### MongoDB

In MongoDB, you use the aggregation framework to perform hierarchical queries. You’ll use `$lookup` for joining data and `$graphLookup` for recursive querying.

Assuming your documents in the `employees` collection look like this:

```json
{
    "_id": ObjectId("..."),
    "name": "John Doe",
    "manager_id": null  // or ObjectId("...")
}
```

Here's how you can find the hierarchy of the CTO:

1. **Find the CTO's `_id`:**
   Just as with SQL, you need to identify the CTO's `_id`.

2. **Use `$graphLookup` to Find Hierarchy:**

```javascript
db.employees.aggregate([
    {
        $match: { name: "CTO" }  // Replace with actual criteria to find CTO
    },
    {
        $graphLookup: {
            from: "employees",
            startWith: "$_id",
            connectFromField: "_id",
            connectToField: "manager_id",
            as: "subordinates"
        }
    },
    {
        $unwind: "$subordinates"
    },
    {
        $graphLookup: {
            from: "employees",
            startWith: "$subordinates._id",
            connectFromField: "_id",
            connectToField: "manager_id",
            as: "subordinates.subordinates"
        }
    },
    {
        $project: {
            name: 1,
            subordinates: {
                name: 1,
                subordinates: {
                    name: 1
                }
            }
        }
    }
]);
```

### Explanation

- **MySQL Recursive CTE**: This uses the `WITH RECURSIVE` clause to build a hierarchy starting from the CTO and recursively joining the employee table to find all subordinates.

- **MongoDB Aggregation**: The `$graphLookup` stage is used to perform recursive lookups to build the hierarchy of employees under the CTO. The `$unwind` stage is used to decompose the arrays of subordinates into individual documents.

Make sure to adapt the queries based on the exact structure of your tables or collections.

db.Employees.aggregate([
    {
        $match: { name: "Alice" }  // Replace with actual criteria to find CTO
    },
    {
        $graphLookup: {
            from: "Employees",
            startWith: "$_id",
            connectFromField: "_id",
            connectToField: "manager_id",
            as: "subordinates"
        }
    },
    {
        $unwind: "$subordinates"
    },
    {
        $graphLookup: {
            from: "Employees",
            startWith: "$subordinates._id",
            connectFromField: "_id",
            connectToField: "manager_id",
            as: "subordinates.subordinates"
        }
    },
    {
        $project: {
            name: 1,
            subordinates: {
                name: 1,
                subordinates: {
                    name: 1
                }
            }
        }
    }
]);
