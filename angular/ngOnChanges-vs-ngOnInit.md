`ngOnChanges` and `ngOnInit` are both lifecycle hooks in Angular, but they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios:

1. **ngOnChanges:**
   - **Purpose:** `ngOnChanges` is called every time the input properties of a component change. It receives a `SimpleChanges` object that contains the previous and current values of the input properties.
   - **Usage Scenario:** You would use `ngOnChanges` when you need to react to changes in input properties and perform logic based on these changes. This hook is particularly useful for performing actions like recalculating derived properties, updating dependent data, or reacting to changes in data coming from parent components.
   - **Example:**
     ```typescript
     ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
       // React to input property changes
       if (changes.someInputProperty) {
         // Perform logic based on changes
       }
     }
     ```

2. **ngOnInit:**
   - **Purpose:** `ngOnInit` is called once, after the first `ngOnChanges` (if there are any input property changes) and after the constructor of the component class.
   - **Usage Scenario:** You would use `ngOnInit` for component initialization tasks that need to be performed once when the component is created. This hook is typically used for initializing component properties, fetching initial data from a server, or setting up subscriptions to observables.
   - **Example:**
     ```typescript
     ngOnInit() {
       // Initialize component
       this.loadData();
     }
     ```

**Key Differences:**
- `ngOnChanges` is triggered every time an input property changes, providing you with detailed information about what has changed.
- `ngOnInit` is triggered once during component initialization, after the first `ngOnChanges`, and is used for general initialization tasks.

**Choosing Between Them:**
- If you need to react specifically to changes in input properties and perform different actions based on these changes, use `ngOnChanges`.
- If you have initialization tasks that should only happen once when the component is created, use `ngOnInit`.

In summary, `ngOnChanges` is reactive to input property changes, while `ngOnInit` is used for initialization tasks. They serve complementary roles in managing component lifecycle and state changes in Angular applications.
