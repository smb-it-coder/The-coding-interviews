In Angular, `@Input` and `@Output` are decorators used to facilitate communication between components:

1. **@Input Decorator:**
   - **Purpose:** `@Input` is used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
   - **Usage:** You apply `@Input` to a property of the child component class. This property can then be set by the parent component in the parent's template using property binding (`[propertyName]`).
   - **Example:**
     ```typescript
     @Input() itemCount: number;
     ```
     In the parent component's template:
     ```html
     <app-child-component [itemCount]="parentItemCount"></app-child-component>
     ```
     Here, `itemCount` in the child component receives the value of `parentItemCount` from the parent.

2. **@Output Decorator:**
   - **Purpose:** `@Output` is used to emit events from a child component to a parent component.
   - **Usage:** You apply `@Output` to an event emitter property of the child component class. This property should be an instance of `EventEmitter`.
   - **Example:**
     ```typescript
     @Output() itemClicked: EventEmitter<number> = new EventEmitter<number>();
     ```
     In the child component:
     ```typescript
     onClick() {
       this.itemClicked.emit(itemId);
     }
     ```
     In the parent component's template:
     ```html
     <app-child-component (itemClicked)="onItemClicked($event)"></app-child-component>
     ```
     Here, `itemClicked` in the child component emits an event that the parent component listens to via `(itemClicked)="..."`.

**Key Differences:**

- **Direction:** 
  - `@Input` passes data from a parent component to a child component.
  - `@Output` sends data from a child component to a parent component via events.

- **Decorator Type:**
  - `@Input` is used with a property in the child component.
  - `@Output` is used with an event emitter property in the child component.

- **Typical Use Cases:**
  - Use `@Input` when you want to pass data (such as configuration settings or data for rendering) from a parent to a child component.
  - Use `@Output` when you want a child component to notify a parent component about events or actions (such as button clicks or changes).

- **Implementation Details:**
  - Both `@Input` and `@Output` use Angular's change detection and binding mechanisms to facilitate communication between components.

In summary, `@Input` and `@Output` decorators are essential for building modular and reusable Angular components that can interact seamlessly with each other by passing data and events in a structured and predictable manner.
