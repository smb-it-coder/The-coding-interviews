Debugging Node.js applications effectively involves using a variety of tools and techniques. Here are some commonly used ones:

1. **Console.log Statements**: This is the most basic form of debugging where you output values or messages to the console to understand the flow and state of your application.

2. **Debugger Statement**: Node.js supports the `debugger` statement, which allows you to pause code execution and inspect variables in the Node.js debugger.

   ```javascript
   debugger;
   ```

3. **Node.js Debugger (`node inspect`)**: Node.js comes with a built-in debugger that can be accessed using the `node inspect` command. This starts a debugging session where you can step through your code, set breakpoints, and inspect variables.

   ```bash
   node inspect your_script.js
   ```

4. **Chrome DevTools with Node.js**: You can use Chrome DevTools to debug Node.js applications. This requires starting your Node.js application with the `--inspect` flag and then opening `chrome://inspect` in Chrome to connect to your Node.js instance.

   ```bash
   node --inspect your_script.js
   ```

5. **Visual Studio Code Debugger**: If you use Visual Studio Code, it has built-in support for debugging Node.js applications. You can set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables directly within the editor.

6. **Logging Libraries**: Libraries like `debug` or `winston` can provide more structured logging capabilities, allowing you to log messages with different levels (info, debug, error) and categorize logs.

7. **Monitoring Tools**: Tools like `pm2` can help monitor and manage Node.js applications in production environments, providing insights into performance and errors.

8. **Profiling**: For performance issues, Node.js provides built-in profiling tools (`--inspect` with CPU profiling) or you can use external tools like `clinic.js` for more detailed performance analysis.

9. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling techniques (try-catch blocks, error-first callbacks, Promise rejections) help in catching and managing errors effectively.

10. **Unit Testing and Integration Testing**: Writing comprehensive tests can help catch bugs early and ensure that different parts of your application work correctly together.

Using a combination of these tools and techniques allows you to effectively debug Node.js applications, whether during development or in production environments.
