As a large language model, I can't directly debug applications, but I can inform you on the various tools and techniques commonly used for debugging Node.js applications:

**Debugging Techniques:**

1. **Logging:**  A fundamental technique for tracing program execution and identifying errors. Console logs with timestamps and context (variables, function names) can provide valuable insights.

2. **Console Debugging:** The built-in `debugger` statement in Node.js allows you to pause execution at specific points in your code and inspect variables using the `console` object within the debugger prompt.

3. **Error Handling:**  Proper error handling with `try...catch` blocks is crucial for catching exceptions and preventing program crashes. Analyze the error messages and stack traces to pinpoint the source of the issue.

4. **Assertions:**  Using the `assert` module allows you to add checks at specific points in your code to verify assumptions about variable values or program state. Assertions that fail will throw errors, helping identify issues early on.

**Debugging Tools:**

1. **Node.js Inspector:** This built-in debugger allows you to remotely debug your Node.js application using Chrome DevTools. You can start your application with the `--inspect` flag and then connect to it from Chrome DevTools to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code.

2. **VS Code Debugger:**  If you're using Visual Studio Code as your editor, it has a built-in debugger that provides a convenient way to debug Node.js applications directly within the IDE. You can set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables.

3. **Third-Party Debuggers:**  Several third-party debuggers offer additional features or integrations with specific IDEs. Popular options include:
    * **WebStorm Debugger:**  Provides a powerful debugger for Node.js and other JavaScript environments within the JetBrains WebStorm IDE.
    * **Debugged:**  A web-based debugger that allows you to debug Node.js applications in the browser.
    * **NTT-Debugger:**  A command-line debugger with a focus on asynchronous code.

4. **Debugging Profilers:**  Tools like `chrome://devtools/discover` (Chrome DevTools Profiling) or `callsite` can help identify performance bottlenecks in your Node.js application. These profilers can reveal information about CPU usage, memory allocation, and function call times. 

**Choosing the Right Tools and Techniques:**

The best approach often involves a combination of techniques and tools. Here's a general guideline:

* **Start with basic techniques:** Logging, console debugging, and proper error handling are excellent starting points for most debugging scenarios.
* **Leverage debuggers for deeper inspection:** When you need to step through code line by line, set breakpoints, and inspect variables in real-time, debuggers like the Node.js inspector or VS Code debugger become valuable tools.
* **Use profilers for performance issues:** If your application is slow or unresponsive, profilers can pinpoint performance bottlenecks for optimization.

By effectively combining these techniques and tools, you can efficiently debug your Node.js applications and ensure they function as expected.



const assert = require('assert');

function addNumbers(x, y) {
  // Simulate a potential error where addition is not performed correctly
  if (x === 5) {
    return 'Invalid Input';  // Returning a string instead of a number
  }
  return x + y;
}

// Test case 1: Valid input, assertion should pass
const result1 = addNumbers(3, 4);
assert.equal(result1, 7, "Function should return the sum of x and y");

// Test case 2: Invalid input, assertion should fail
const result2 = addNumbers(5, 2);  // This will trigger the error condition
assert.equal(result2, 7, "Function should return the sum of x and y (This assertion will fail)");

console.log("All assertions passed!");  // This line won't be reached if the second assertion fails
