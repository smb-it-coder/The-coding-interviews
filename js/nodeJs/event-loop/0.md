According to the article, the event loop is a fundamental part of Node.js that enables asynchronous programming by ensuring the main thread is not blocked. It is a loop that runs continuously as long as your Node.js application is up and running. There are six different queues in every loop, each holding one or more callback functions that need to be executed on the call stack eventually.

The event loop works by giving priority to any callbacks in the microtask queue, then moving on to timers, I/O callbacks, check callbacks, and close callbacks. After these queues are processed, the event loop will check if there are more callbacks to be processed. If so, the loop keeps running. Otherwise, the event loop exits.

Here are the different queues and how they are handled by the event loop:

* Microtask queue: This queue has two separate queues, nextTick queue and Promise queue. Callbacks in the nextTick queue are executed first, then tasks in the promise queue.
* Timer queue: This queue holds callbacks associated with setTimeout and setInterval. These callbacks are executed at the specified time.
* I/O queue: This queue contains callbacks associated with all the async methods such as methods associated with the fs and http modules.
* Check queue: This queue holds callbacks associated with the setImmediate function.
* Close queue: This queue holds callbacks associated with the close event of an async task.

Overall, the event loop is a complex system, but it is essential for understanding how Node.js handles asynchronous operations.
