### **Best Practices for Requesting Permissions**

1. **Request Minimum Necessary Permissions**: Only ask for permissions that are essential for the extension’s functionality to minimize privacy concerns and reduce user trust issues.
2. **Explain Permissions Clearly**: Provide clear explanations to users about why each permission is needed and how it will be used, especially in the extension’s description and privacy policy.
3. **Use Optional Permissions**: For permissions that are not immediately necessary, use optional permissions and request them at runtime to improve user experience and trust.

By carefully selecting and managing permissions, extension developers can ensure that their extensions are both functional and respectful of user privacy.
