If you’re seeing the message "No result received from extension," it means the `result` variable is `undefined`, indicating that the callback from `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` is not returning any data. This could be due to several reasons:

### Common Reasons for `undefined` Result

1. **Background Script Issues:**
   - The background script might not be properly set up to handle messages or might not be sending a response.
   - Ensure that your background script has a listener for messages and that it responds correctly.

2. **Extension ID Issues:**
   - The `extensionID` might be incorrect or not match the ID of the extension that should receive the message.
   - Verify that the ID you’re using matches the actual extension ID.

3. **Incorrect Message Format:**
   - The format of the `data` being sent might not be what the background script expects, causing it to ignore or mishandle the message.

4. **Permissions and Manifest Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the manifest file of your extension includes the necessary permissions for messaging.
   - Check that the background script is declared correctly in the manifest file.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Background Script Listener:**
   Ensure your background script has a proper message listener. Here’s a basic example:

   ```javascript
   // background.js
   chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
       console.log('Message received in background script:', message);
       // Handle the message and send a response
       sendResponse({ success: true, data: 'Your response data' });
   });
   ```

2. **Verify Extension ID:**
   Double-check that the `extensionID` is correctly set and is the ID of the extension that is supposed to handle the message.

3. **Inspect Network and Console Logs:**
   - Use the Chrome DevTools to inspect the background page console logs. Look for any errors or logs that might indicate issues.
   - Ensure there are no JavaScript errors in your background script that might be preventing it from executing.

4. **Check Manifest File:**
   Verify that your `manifest.json` file includes the necessary permissions and that the background script is correctly specified:

   ```json
   {
     "manifest_version": 3,
     "name": "Your Extension",
     "version": "1.0",
     "permissions": [
       "storage",
       "activeTab",
       "scripting"
     ],
     "background": {
       "service_worker": "background.js"
     }
   }
   ```

### Example Background Script Handling

Here’s a simple example of a background script that listens for messages and responds:

```javascript
// background.js
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
    console.log('Received message:', message);

    // Example of handling the message and sending a response
    if (message.action === 'getData') {
        sendResponse({ success: true, data: 'Sample data from background script' });
    } else {
        sendResponse({ success: false, error: 'Unknown action' });
    }

    // Indicate that you will send a response asynchronously
    return true;
});
```

### Example of Sending and Receiving Messages

Ensure your content script or other sender script is sending messages correctly:

```javascript
// content_script.js or another sender script
chrome.runtime.sendMessage(extensionID, { action: 'getData' }, (result) => {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
        console.error('Error sending message:', chrome.runtime.lastError);
    } else {
        console.log('Received result:', result);
    }
});
```

By following these steps and checking these areas, you should be able to diagnose why the `result` is `undefined` and ensure proper communication between your scripts and the background page.
