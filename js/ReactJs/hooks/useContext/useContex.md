I'd be glad to explain the `useContext` hook in React in depth, along with a live example:

**What is `useContext`?**

The `useContext` hook, introduced in React 16.8, provides a way to share data across components without explicitly passing props down through the component tree. This can be particularly useful when dealing with global application state or data that is needed by components at different levels of nesting.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Context API:** The foundation of `useContext` is the Context API, which consists of two main components:
    - **`createContext`:** This function creates a React Context object. It's used to define the type of data that will be shared through the context.
    - **Provider:** A component that wraps the part of the component tree where the context value will be accessible. This component provides the actual value to be shared.
- **Consumer:** While technically part of the Context API, the `useContext` hook has largely replaced the `Consumer` component. It's used within child components to access the shared data from the context.

**Benefits of `useContext`:**

- **Simplified Prop Drilling:** Eliminates the need to pass props down through multiple levels of components, making code cleaner and easier to maintain.
- **Global State Management (Alternative):** Can be used for managing global application state in simpler scenarios, although for more complex cases, consider using a state management library like Redux or Zustand.

**Live Example: Themed App**

Let's build a simple themed app to demonstrate `useContext`:

1. **Create the Context:**

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = createContext({
  theme: 'light',
  toggleTheme: () => {},
});
```

- We create a context named `ThemeContext` using `createContext`.
- The initial value of the context is an object with a `theme` property (set to 'light' initially) and a `toggleTheme` function (placeholder for now).

2. **Theme Provider:**

```javascript
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));
  };

  const value = { theme, toggleTheme };

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

- The `ThemeProvider` component wraps the part of the component tree where the theme will be accessible.
- It manages the theme state using `useState` and provides a `toggleTheme` function to change the theme.
- The `value` object passed to the `ThemeProvider.Provider` contains the current theme and the `toggleTheme` function, making them accessible to child components.

3. **Consuming the Context (useContext):**

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: theme === 'light' ? 'white' : 'black' }}>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Inside the `MyComponent`, we use the `useContext` hook with the `ThemeContext` to access the `theme` and `toggleTheme` values from the context.
- We then use the `theme` value to style the component's background color and call the `toggleTheme` function when the button is clicked.

**Running the Example:**

1. Wrap your main application component with the `ThemeProvider`:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      {/* Your app components here */}
      <MyComponent />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

2. Now, any component within the `ThemeProvider` can access the theme and toggle it using the `useContext` hook.

**Additional Considerations:**

- While `useContext` is great for simpler state management, for complex needs, consider using a state management library like Redux or Zustand.
- Overusing context can lead to tight coupling of components. Use context judiciously for truly global or shared data.

By following these steps and understanding the concepts, you can effectively use `useContext` to share data across components in your React applications.
