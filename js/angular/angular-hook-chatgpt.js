In Angular, components go through various lifecycle stages from creation to destruction. These stages are managed by Angular's lifecycle hooks, which are methods that you can implement in your component class to react to these stages. Understanding these lifecycle hooks is crucial for managing component initialization, change detection, and cleanup tasks effectively. Here's an overview of the Angular component lifecycle hooks:

1. **ngOnChanges:**
   - This hook is called when one or more input properties of the component change.
   - It receives a `SimpleChanges` object that contains previous and current values of the changed properties.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
       // React to input property changes
     }
     ```

2. **ngOnInit:**
   - This hook is called once, after the first `ngOnChanges`.
   - It is used for component initialization logic.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     ngOnInit() {
       // Initialize component
     }
     ```

3. **ngDoCheck:**
   - This hook is called during every change detection run.
   - It allows you to implement your own change detection logic.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     ngDoCheck() {
       // Custom change detection logic
     }
     ```

4. **ngAfterContentInit:**
   - This hook is called after Angular projects external content into the component's view (like `<ng-content>`).
   - It marks the end of the initialization of content that was projected into the component.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     ngAfterContentInit() {
       // After content initialization
     }
     ```

5. **ngAfterContentChecked:**
   - This hook is called after Angular checks the content projected into the component.
   - It is called whenever the projected content changes.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     ngAfterContentChecked() {
       // After content checked
     }
     ```

6. **ngAfterViewInit:**
   - This hook is called after Angular initializes the component's views and child views (after the view DOM is rendered).
   - It marks the end of the initialization of the component's view.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     ngAfterViewInit() {
       // After view initialization
     }
     ```

7. **ngAfterViewChecked:**
   - This hook is called after Angular checks the component's views and child views.
   - It is called whenever the view or child views change.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     ngAfterViewChecked() {
       // After view checked
     }
     ```

8. **ngOnDestroy:**
   - This hook is called just before the component is destroyed.
   - It is used for cleanup logic such as unsubscribing from observables or detaching event handlers to avoid memory leaks.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     ngOnDestroy() {
       // Clean up resources
     }
     ```

These lifecycle hooks provide a way to tap into key moments in the lifecycle of a component, allowing you to perform initialization, change detection, and cleanup operations as needed. Understanding when to use each hook ensures that your components behave predictably and efficiently throughout their lifecycle.
