/**
 * 
 * Angular provides a well-defined directory structure to organize your application's code. While the basic structure is set up by the Angular CLI, you can customize it to fit your project's needs.

Basic Structure
Here's a breakdown of the main directories and their purpose:

src folder
    Contains the source code of your application.
    app: Contains the main application module, components, services, and other related files.
    assets: Stores static assets like images, fonts, and configuration files.
    environments: Contains environment-specific configuration files (e.g., environment.ts, environment.prod.ts).
    index.html: The main HTML file of the application.
    main.ts: The application's entry point.
    polyfills.ts: Includes polyfills for older browsers.
    styles.css: Global styles for the application.
    test: Contains test files.
app folder
    app.component.ts: The root component of the application.
    app.component.html: The template for the root component.
    app.component.css: Styles for the root component.
    app.module.ts: The main module of the application.
    Additional Folders and Files
    Depending on your project's complexity, you might have additional folders and files:

shared: For components, services, and pipes that are shared across multiple modules.
core: For core application logic, services, and utilities.
features: For feature-specific modules and components.
models: For data models.
utils: For utility functions.

Best Practices
Consistency: Maintain a consistent naming convention for files and folders.
Modularity: Organize your code into logical modules and components.
Reusability: Utilize shared modules for common components and services.
Testability: Consider the structure of your code for easy testing.
Maintainability: Keep the structure clean and organized for future modifications.
