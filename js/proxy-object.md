In JavaScript, a proxy object is an object that wraps another object or function and intercepts fundamental operations (like property lookup, assignment, invocation, etc.) on the wrapped object. This allows you to customize or add behavior to the operations on the wrapped object without directly modifying it.

Here's a basic example to illustrate:

```javascript
// Creating a target object
let target = {
  message: "Hello"
};

// Creating a proxy for the target object
let handler = {
  // Intercepting property access
  get: function(target, prop, receiver) {
    console.log(`Getting property "${prop}"`);
    return target[prop];
  },
  // Intercepting property assignment
  set: function(target, prop, value, receiver) {
    console.log(`Setting property "${prop}" to ${value}`);
    target[prop] = value;
  }
};

let proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);

// Accessing properties through the proxy
console.log(proxy.message); // Output: Getting property "message", then "Hello"
proxy.message = "Hello World"; // Output: Setting property "message" to Hello World
console.log(proxy.message); // Output: Getting property "message", then "Hello World"
```

In this example:
- `target` is the original object.
- `handler` is an object that defines traps (methods) for various operations on the `target`.
- `Proxy` is used to create a proxy object (`proxy`) that wraps `target` using `handler`.

The `handler` defines methods like `get` and `set` which intercept attempts to access or modify properties on the `target` through the `proxy`. This interception allows you to log or modify behavior before or after the operations on the `target`.

Proxy objects are powerful for implementing various advanced features like validation, logging, caching, etc., without altering the original object directly, thus promoting cleaner and more modular code. They are widely used in modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries for data binding, state management, and more.
