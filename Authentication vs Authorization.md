Authentication and authorization are two fundamental concepts in security and access control within software systems, but they serve distinct purposes:

### **Authentication**

**Definition:** Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question: "Who are you?"

**Purpose:** To ensure that the user or system trying to access resources is who they claim to be.

**Common Methods:**
- **Username and Password:** The most common form, where users provide credentials to prove their identity.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of identification, such as a code sent to a mobile device.
- **Biometrics:** Uses physical characteristics like fingerprints or facial recognition for identification.
- **Tokens:** Digital tokens (e.g., OAuth tokens, JWT) are used to authenticate API requests.

**Examples:**
- Logging into an email account with your username and password.
- Scanning a fingerprint to unlock a smartphone.

### **Authorization**

**Definition:** Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do. It answers the question: "What can you do?"

**Purpose:** To ensure that a user or system has permission to access specific resources or perform certain actions.

**Common Methods:**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Permissions are assigned based on user roles (e.g., admin, user, guest).
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Permissions are based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Defines specific permissions for different users or groups on resources.
- **Policies:** Define rules and conditions for accessing resources.

**Examples:**
- An employee can view their own personal data but cannot access HR records.
- A user with an admin role can manage all users, while a regular user cannot.

### **Key Differences**

- **Scope:**
  - **Authentication:** Confirms the identity of the user or system.
  - **Authorization:** Determines the level of access and permissions once identity is confirmed.

- **Order:**
  - **Authentication** typically occurs before **authorization**. First, you need to prove who you are, then you can determine what you're allowed to do.

- **Implementation:**
  - **Authentication** often involves credentials like passwords, tokens, or biometrics.
  - **Authorization** involves setting and enforcing access controls based on roles, attributes, or policies.

### **Example Scenario**

Imagine a web application with a banking system:

1. **Authentication:** A user logs into their account by providing their username and password. The system verifies these credentials to confirm the user's identity.

2. **Authorization:** Once authenticated, the system checks the userâ€™s permissions. For instance, a user might have permission to view their own transaction history but not access other users' accounts or perform administrative tasks like modifying user permissions.

### **Summary**

- **Authentication** is about verifying identity.
- **Authorization** is about granting or denying access to resources based on that identity.

Both authentication and authorization are crucial for securing applications and ensuring that users have appropriate access to resources based on their roles and permissions.
